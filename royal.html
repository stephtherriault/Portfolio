        <p> 4 week UX project in a senior digital design course. Working within a team of 6 students. My role was <em> Ux Designer, Motion Designer, and Video Producer</em> which means I helped guide design strategy and lead the communication of the final artefact.</p>

      <h4> A Sector-wide Problem</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p>
        Travel can be stressful, even if it’s a vacation. After an investigation into the cruise sector, we found that Royal Caribbean stands the most to gain by addressing the anxiety that comes with cruise travel. Compared to the relaxed pampering that happens aboard a cruise ship, the stress of disembarking to explore a port destination alone can feel overwhelming. To solve this we aimed to <em>leverage Royal Caribbean’s brand of hospitality to alleviate onshore travel anxieties.</em>

      <h4> Researching With Real people</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="one-column-text">
      <p>  By surveying 80+ cruisers we established that they worry most about safety, language barriers, emergency information, travel documentation, and cultural considerations for the ports they're exploring. During our 7 in-person interviews, I took notes on body language and past crusie experience to help determine which areas of Royal’s current app could be improved to address their fears. </p>

      <h4> Guiding Principles</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="one-column-text">
      <p> In order to truly extend Royal Caribbean’s hospitality onshore, we needed to be clear, fast, and tie back to the real world. By being transparent that problems can happen on vacation, cruisers can relax easier knowing they are prepared. </p>

      <p> In the final week of the project, the team focussed on high fidelity execution, while it was my responsibility to present our work through 2 videos: concept and walkthrough. A challenge I ran into was directing voice actors for the first time. Tone, pace, and measure of speaking can all communicate different qualities that may or may not be desired. To solve this problem I dipped into my theatre background and built a proto-persona for the actor to adopt as if it was a character, actually creating a coherent “brand voice”. As the project drew to a close, my production pipeline began setting deadlines for other teammates so I took on a managing role overseeing the convergence of prototype and presentation. </p>

      <h4> Reflection</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="one-column-text">
      <p> I am incredibly proud of this project as it was one of my first ventures into UX design. If granted more time, further considerations include creating better visual cohesion with the rest of the Royal Caribbean app to fulfil consistency heuristics.

The success of this project is not without thanks to my incredible team: Rachel Au, Gabriel Hendry, Priscilla Lee, Marie Louka and Kit Weir.</p>
