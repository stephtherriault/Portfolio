        <p> A disproportionate amount of homeless youth are lgbtqia+
94% of homeless youth identify as part of the lgbtq community, with almost half being forced from their homes due to family rejection. Tackling this problem takes far more than just an interface; the problem space needed to be scoped down by addressing smaller contributing factors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <h4> Scoping Down and Down and Down</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p> We spent the earliest weeks talking with people to make sure our positioning was sound. We found many fantastic organizations across a spectrum of mediums. However, none had made the jump to mobile, which stood to benefit our target audience (youth) significantly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p> We surveyed 55 respondents, interviewed people who had come out, and followed through on secondary research. This culminated in a chain of insights that justified Haven, and scoped down our problem space:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <ol>
          <li>A disproportionate amount of homeless youth are lgbtqia+. </li>
          <li> A coming out plan can be too much to keep in your head all at once. </li>
          <li> Digital privacy can be hard to come by when you’re young. </li>
        </ol>

        <h4> The Goal</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p> <em> Create a secure space where lgbtqia+ youth can build a plan for coming out that promotes their safety.</em> </p>

    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p> We as designers can’t tell people what to do. We can’t say yes or no, do or don’t come out, because it’s unrealistic to understand such a complex personal situation through just an app. Instead, we trusted the agency of our users to know their own life. We used self evaluative questions because they were effective in prompting people to think more objectively about scenarios they might not realize are crucially important to their safety.</p>

        <h4>A Core Experience From Verified Sources</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p> Since we were designing for youth, we organized our content to be engaging but short; we won’t overwhelm people that already have a lot on their plate. We pulled information from organizations like <a href="https://qmunity.ca/" target="_blank">Qmunity</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ComingOutAsYou.pdf" target="_blank">the Trevor project</a>, and <a href="https://pflag.org/tags/comingout" taget="_blank">Pglaf</a> to frame our content and we used interactive activities, videos, external reasources, and personal stories to break up walls of text.</p>

        <img class="column-image-mockup" src="images/Haven/Conversation-Starters.gif" loading="lazy">
      </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p>Conversation starters help youth test the waters with people around them. Adding them within the context of a conversation made testers feel likelier to put in more information. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p> As modules are completed, important resources, goals, and safety information are saved to the a homepage that helps prepare for best and worst case scenarios. I pushed for this to be the apps homepage so that people could see their overall progress at a glance. Feeling comfortable enough to disclose one's identity can take a long time, so It was important that we <em> highlight what someone has done, rather than how much they had left to do.</em></p>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p>While designing interactions around the content, I was making interaction decisions for the homepage as the primary prototyper. At first we looked at precedents like apple wallet to understand how best to group varied categories of information, but I dropped it after it bloated the homepage by adding redundant information. I learned that “interesting” interfaces can be problematic if they aren’t thoughtfully centred around a user. </p>

        <h4> Supporting a Cognitive Model With Motion</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p> Motion should be motivated and user centred. An issue we faced with early prototypes was that it wasn’t clear enough where information was being saved after an activity was completed. I proposed some small changes to copy, and a healthy dose of motion design.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p> This specific micro-interaction was given to 4 testers to understand where their attention went after the loading was done. Among 3 of them, this animation improved their perception of the bottom nav. As a result, they could more precisely find the information they had saved. </p>

        <h4> Extending Reach </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p> Coming out was a continuous process, but right now I don’t feel like the app is geared towards some of the smaller, less drastic coming our plans that exist like telling a coworker, a cousin, or a doctor. Future exploration and research interviews could look into what kinds of support can be offered for both capital-C Coming out and lower case coming out. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="one-column-text">
        <p>This was my first attempt at taking a leadership role within a UX design team. I am not a part of the LGBT, but I firmly believe that LGBT rights are human rights and everyone should be trying to help solve these issues. I learned to listen and give others a voice, elevate the good ideas in the team rather than following what I think I know vs. someone’s lived experience. One thing that helped me immensely was taking the time to communicate the perspectives I was speaking from: team lead, designer, or cishet man? To end this off, I credit my incredible team: I’m thankful for their passion, their patience, and their willingness to put up with my whiteboard drawings. </p>
